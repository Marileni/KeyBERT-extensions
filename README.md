**Deep Natural Language Processing Project**: Topic Modeling

This repository focuses on **topic modeling** techniques that leverage BERT-based keyword extraction. We explore three main approaches:

1. **Domain Adaptation** – Applying keyword extraction in a specialized domain (e.g., agriculture).  
2. **Multilingual Extension** – Handling documents in the Greek language.
3. **NER-based Preprocessing** – Using Named Entity Recognition to filter or highlight key entities before extracting keywords.

Stay tuned for code examples, usage instructions, and result comparisons in the sections below!
